CMPTGCS-20-S15-lab00 Hello World in Python 2.7


For this lab, there is one goal: write a Python 2.7 program that prints the string `Hello, World!` as its output.

In this sense, we are following a long tradition: for [more than 40 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) it has been a tradition to make printing `Hello, World!` be the first thing you do when learning a new programming language.

In Python, this program is very short.  It looks like this:

```Python
print 'Hello, World!'
```

That's it!   Now, you can also add, on the first line, a *comment* with your name, and information about the course, for example:

```Python
# Chris Gaucho, for CMPTGCS 20, S16
print 'Hello, World!'
```

You are encouraged to do that, because it helps someone looking at your code know that *you* wrote it.  But, other than that, it isn't necessary.  In general, in computer programming, a *comment* is something that is intended only for human readers of the code, and is otherwise "ignored by the system".   Nearly every programming language has some way to express comments, though the exact rules for formatting of comments--that is, the *syntax* of comments--differs from one language to another.

In Python, a `#` starts a comment.  Everything from the `#` to the end of that line is part of the comment.
